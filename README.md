# Operating-System
Semester project : OS designed in C / C++. The RAM hard drive and the number of cores will be given by the user while starting the OS. The resourses are managed while doing multi-tasking. Dual Mode OS: kernel &amp; user mode. Concepts like Contex switching, Process creation, EXEC commands and CPU Scheduling are implemented.
Operating system should have a name of its own that will display on starting the program.
The RAM hard drive and the number of cores will be given by the user while starting the OS. For e.g: instance of OS will have 2GB RAM, 256GB Hard drive and 8 cores you can choose your own convention.
Each task should have a button to close the task in between so to make a simulation of interrupt.
Your operating system should be able to multitask.
Your operating system would have user mode and kernel mode (in kernel mode you can access hardware resources)
The user can then select a specific task and it should start working in a new terminal for that you can use EXEC commands.
If the user starts any other program that will be added into the RAM too. 
A ready queue will schedule all the tasks in the RAM on its own and send them for processing.
